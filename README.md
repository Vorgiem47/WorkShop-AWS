# AWS Workshop - Hosting Websites on AWS

## Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, networking, and databases. AWS allows users to deploy and manage applications efficiently, with scalability and security in mind.

In this workshop, we will cover two exercises to help you understand basic AWS services for web hosting.

## Workshop Overview
This workshop consists of two main exercises:

### 1. Hosting a Static Website using S3 and CloudFront
In this exercise, you will:
- Create an **S3 bucket** to store static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Enable **static website hosting** on the S3 bucket.
- Configure **CloudFront** to distribute the content globally with caching.
- Access the site via a CloudFront-provided URL.

#### Key AWS Services Used:
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage service for hosting static files.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster content delivery.

### 2. Deploying a Web Server on an EC2 Instance
In this exercise, you will:
- Launch an **EC2 instance** (virtual machine) using Amazon Linux 2.
- Install and configure **Apache** to serve a web page.
- Ensure the instance is accessible via a **public IP**.

#### Key AWS Services Used:
- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers in the cloud.
- **Security Groups**: AWS firewall rules to allow HTTP and SSH access.

## Prerequisites
- An **AWS Free Tier** account.
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands (for EC2 setup).

## Conclusion
By the end of this workshop, you will have experience in deploying and managing web applications on AWS using S3, CloudFront, and EC2. These are fundamental skills for cloud-based web hosting and infrastructure management.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
